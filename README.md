# adriox

This project is a web application that allows users to easily find and view information about their IP address and location. The application uses the ipapi.co API to retrieve information about the user's IP address, including the user's city, region, country, postal code, timezone, latitude and longitude, and other information such as the user's ASN, organization, and currency. The application also includes a map feature that allows users to view the location of their IP address on a map, as well as a feature that displays the flag of the user's country. Additionally, the application includes a feature that allows users to easily access the Google Maps website for their location. The application is built using Streamlit, a python library for building web applications, and makes use of JavaScript and CSS for additional functionality. Overall, this project aims to provide users with an easy and convenient way to find and view information about their IP address and location.
